# Deep Learning – DNN Practice Projects

This repository contains multiple practice projects built using **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)**.  
The goal is to learn, experiment, and improve skills in building, training, and evaluating neural network models on different datasets.

## 📌 Project Structure
- **Notebooks**: Each folder contains a Jupyter notebook with the full workflow.
- **DNN Models**: All projects are implemented using fully-connected neural networks (Dense layers).
- **Datasets**: Public datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **Evaluation**: Each project includes accuracy, loss, F1-score, and other metrics depending on the task.

## 🧠 What Each Project Covers
- Data loading & preprocessing  
- Encoding categorical features  
- Scaling numerical features  
- Splitting into train/test  
- Building a DNN model  
- Training with validation  
- Evaluating performance  
- Visualizing results (when included)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)

## 🎯 Purpose
This repo helps track progress while practicing deep learning fundamentals and experimenting with different models, parameters, and datasets.
